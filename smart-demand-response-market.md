<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Smart Demand Response Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Voluntary</li><li>Contractually Mandatory</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Smart Demand Response (SDR) is a market-based approach used in electricity grids to encourage end-users to modify their electricity usage during periods of high demand or supply constraints. In voluntary SDR markets, participants have the freedom to decide whether or not to participate and adjust their electricity consumption. On the other hand, in contractually mandatory SDR markets, participants are obligated by contractual agreements with grid operators or utility companies to modify their electricity usage, ensuring a reliable and efficient grid operation. These market types provide flexibility and optimize electricity consumption patterns while meeting the energy needs of the system.</p></p>
