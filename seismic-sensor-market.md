<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Seismic Sensor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Inertial Seismometer</li><li>Extensometer</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The seismic sensor market encompasses various types of sensors used for detecting and measuring seismic activity. Two common types include inertial seismometers and extensometers. Inertial seismometers rely on the principle of inertia, measuring ground motion through the displacement of a mass relative to a fixed reference frame. On the other hand, extensometers primarily measure strain in the Earth's crust by monitoring the deformation or extension of rocks. Both sensors play crucial roles in earthquake monitoring, geological surveys, and structural health monitoring applications.</p></p>
