<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The CO2 Fire Suppression System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>High Pressure CO2 Systems</li><li>Low Pressure CO2 Systems</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The CO2 fire suppression system market can be categorized into two types: high-pressure CO2 systems and low-pressure CO2 systems. High-pressure CO2 systems use cylinders filled with carbon dioxide gas stored at high pressure. When a fire breaks out, the system releases CO2 at a high velocity to quickly suppress the flames. Low-pressure CO2 systems, on the other hand, use a fixed storage unit or bulk tank to store CO2 at a lower pressure. These systems release CO2 through a network of pipes and nozzles, effectively controlling and extinguishing fires.</p></p>

<p><strong>The CO2 Fire Suppression System Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Surface-Type Fires</li><li>Potential Deep-Seated Fires</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The CO2 fire suppression system market caters to the application of extinguishing surface-type fires and potential deep-seated fires. Surface-type fires refer to fires that occur on the surface of a solid material, such as wood or paper. Potential deep-seated fires, on the other hand, are fires that may start small but have the potential to spread and become more intense, often hidden within materials like insulation or machinery. The CO2 fire suppression system is designed to rapidly extinguish these types of fires by displacing oxygen and cooling the fire source.</p></p>
