<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cerebral Flow Diverter and Disruptor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Flow Diverters</li><li>Endosaccular Disruptors</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Cerebral Flow Diverter and Disruptor market consist of two main types: Flow Diverters and Endosaccular Disruptors. Flow diverters are small stents placed in the bloodstream to divert blood flow away from a weakened or bulging vessel, reducing the risk of rupture. On the other hand, endosaccular disruptors are devices inserted inside brain aneurysms to disrupt blood flow and promote clotting, preventing the aneurysm from growing or rupturing. Both these market types offer innovative solutions for treating cerebrovascular disorders and reducing the associated risks.</p></p>
