<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Urethroscope Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Rigid</li><li>Flexible</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Urethroscope market is segmented into two types: Rigid and Flexible. Rigid urethroscopes have a fixed shape and are used for direct visualization inside the urethra. They offer higher resolution images but require more skill and can be uncomfortable for patients. Flexible urethroscopes, on the other hand, can navigate bends in the urethra and reach the bladder easily. They are more comfortable for patients but may offer slightly lower image quality. Both types cater to different medical needs and preferences, providing options for urologists to choose from.</p></p>
