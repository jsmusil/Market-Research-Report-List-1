<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Pneumatic Clutches Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Friction Type</li><li>Toothed Type</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Pneumatic clutches are used in various mechanical applications to transmit torque from one shaft to another. They can be classified into two main types: Friction Type and Toothed Type. Friction type clutches engage and disengage by pressing friction materials together, providing smooth and gradual torque transfer. Toothed type clutches, on the other hand, utilize toothed components that interlock or disengage to transmit torque instantaneously. Both types offer reliable and efficient torque transmission capabilities, but their mechanisms and characteristics differ in terms of engagement style and overall performance.</p></p>
