<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Butt Weld Reducers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Concentric</li><li>Eccentric</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Butt weld reducers are commonly used in piping systems to connect pipes of different sizes. There are two main types of butt weld reducers: concentric and eccentric. Concentric reducers have a symmetrical shape, meaning that the centerline of the inlet and outlet is aligned. They are mainly used when there is a small difference in pipe sizes. On the other hand, eccentric reducers have an offset centerline, which allows for a gradual reduction in pipe sizes. They are primarily used when there is a need to avoid trapping air or liquids in the piping system.</p></p>
