<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Pharmacokinetics Services Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Small Molecules Pharmacokinetics Services</li><li>Large Molecules (Biopharmaceuticals) Pharmacokinetics Services</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Pharmacokinetics services involve the study of how drugs are absorbed, distributed, metabolized, and eliminated by the body. There are two main types of pharmacokinetics services markets: small molecules and large molecules (biopharmaceuticals). Small molecules pharmacokinetics services focus on the analysis of traditional, chemically synthesized drugs. On the other hand, large molecules pharmacokinetics services specialize in studying the pharmacokinetics of biopharmaceuticals, such as proteins and antibodies, which are derived from living organisms. These services aid in understanding how drugs interact with the body and help in the development of safe and effective medications.</p></p>
