<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Ammonia Absorption Chillers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Evaporator</li><li>Absorber</li><li>Pump</li><li>Generator</li><li>Analyzer</li><li>Others</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Ammonia absorption chillers are classified into various market types based on different components. The evaporator is responsible for cooling the ammonia vapor, while the absorber absorbs the ammonia vapor using a weak solution. The pump transfers the weak ammonia solution to the generator, where it gets heated and releases ammonia vapor. The generator requires an energy source to heat the weak solution. The analyzer helps monitor and control the chiller's performance. Lastly, other components include condensers, condenser pumps, and heat exchangers. These components work together to enable the ammonia absorption chiller to provide cooling.</p></p>
