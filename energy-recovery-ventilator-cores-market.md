<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Energy Recovery Ventilator Cores Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Crossflow</li><li>Counter-flow</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Energy recovery ventilator (ERV) cores are classified into two main types: crossflow and counter-flow. In the crossflow configuration, the airstreams move perpendicularly, allowing for efficient heat transfer between the supply and exhaust air. This type is simpler in design and more cost-effective, making it suitable for residential applications. On the other hand, counter-flow ERV cores have the airstreams flowing in opposite directions, maximizing the heat exchange efficiency. This type is commonly used in commercial buildings and large-scale ventilation systems, where high heat transfer efficiency is crucial.</p></p>
