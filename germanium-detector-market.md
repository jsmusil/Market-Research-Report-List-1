<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Germanium Detector Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Liquid Cooling</li><li>Electric Cooling</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Germanium Detector market can be categorized into two types: liquid cooling and electric cooling. Liquid cooling refers to a system where a coolant is used to dissipate heat generated by the detector. It involves the circulation of a liquid through the detector to cool it down. On the other hand, electric cooling utilizes an electrical cooling mechanism to remove heat from the detector. This can involve the use of fans or other electrical components to effectively cool the Germanium Detector. Both types aim to maintain optimal operating temperatures for the detector's efficient performance.</p></p>
