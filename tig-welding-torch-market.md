<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The TIG Welding Torch Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Water Cooled</li><li>Air Cooled</li></ul></p>
<p><p>TIG welding torches are available in two main types: water-cooled and air-cooled. Water-cooled torches use a water-cooling system to keep the torch cool during welding, allowing for longer continuous welding without overheating. These torches are generally preferred for heavy-duty applications that require high amperage and extensive welding time. On the other hand, air-cooled torches rely on the surrounding air to cool the torch, making them more suitable for lighter applications that don't require constant, high-amperage welding. The choice between these two types depends on the specific welding needs and requirements of the user.</p></p>
