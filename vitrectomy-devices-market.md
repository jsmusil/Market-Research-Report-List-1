<p><strong>The Vitrectomy Devices Market Industry Research by Application is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Epiretinal Membrane</li><li>Diabetic Retinopathy</li><li>Retinal Detachment</li><li>Macular Hole</li><li>Others</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The vitrectomy devices market is primarily driven by applications in various retinal disorders such as epiretinal membrane, diabetic retinopathy, retinal detachment, macular hole, and others. Epiretinal membrane refers to the formation of a thin tissue layer on the retina, while diabetic retinopathy is associated with vision loss caused by damage to blood vessels in the retina. Retinal detachment occurs when the retina separates from the surrounding tissue, and a macular hole is a small break in the macula, resulting in blurred or distorted vision. These conditions require the use of vitrectomy devices for surgical intervention and treatment.</p></p>
