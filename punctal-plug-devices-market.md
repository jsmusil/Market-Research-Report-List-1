<p><strong>The Punctal Plug Devices Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Temporary Punctal Plugs</li><li>Permanent Punctal Plugs</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Punctal plug devices are used to treat dry eyes by blocking the tear drainage system. Temporary punctal plugs are inserted into the puncta (tiny openings in the corner of the eyelids) and can be easily removed after a certain period. They provide short-term relief. On the other hand, permanent punctal plugs are made of longer-lasting materials and are meant to remain in the puncta for an extended period, providing long-term relief. Both types of punctal plugs are designed to retain moisture on the eye surface and alleviate dry eye symptoms.</p></p>
