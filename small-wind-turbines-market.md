<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Small Wind Turbines Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Horizontal Axis Wind Turbine</li><li>Vertical Axis Wind Turbine</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The small wind turbines market includes two types: horizontal axis wind turbine (HAWT) and vertical axis wind turbine (VAWT). HAWTs have a horizontal spinning axis and are commonly used due to their higher efficiency and power generation. They are ideal for urban or suburban areas. On the other hand, VAWTs have a vertical spinning axis and are suitable for areas with varying wind directions. They are less efficient than HAWTs but are quieter and require less maintenance. Both types contribute to the renewable energy sector, with HAWTs being more prevalent.</p></p>
