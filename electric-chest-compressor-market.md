<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Electric Chest Compressor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Invasive</li><li>Non-invasive</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The electric chest compressor market consists of two types: invasive and non-invasive compressors. Invasive chest compressors are used during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) or in intensive care units, where a tube is inserted into the patient's trachea to maintain an open airway. These compressors provide direct air pressure to the lungs, assisting with breathing. On the other hand, non-invasive chest compressors are used outside of medical settings and are designed to provide external assistance during CPR without the need for intubation. They deliver compressions to the chest, helping to circulate blood and oxygen in the body.</p></p>
