On the other hand, hip articulated orthoses allow controlled movement of the hip joint while still providing support. This type of orthosis is often used in cases where some mobility is desirable, such as during rehabilitation or for children with hip dysplasia. Both types of orthoses aim to improve hip function and correct developmental abnormalities.</p></p>
