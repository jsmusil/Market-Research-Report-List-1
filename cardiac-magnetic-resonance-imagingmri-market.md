<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging(MRI) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Closed System</li><li>Opened System</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Cardiac Magnetic Resonance Imaging(MRI) is a type of medical imaging technology used to evaluate the structure and function of the heart. There are two main types of MRI systems used for cardiac imaging: Closed Systems and Open Systems. Closed Systems are large machines that completely surround the patient during imaging, providing high-quality images but may cause discomfort for some patients. Open Systems, on the other hand, are more open and spacious, making them more comfortable for patients but may sacrifice some image quality compared to Closed Systems.</p></p>
